**Statistical Theory of Strength of Bundles of Threads**                                                                                    
**March 2020 – Present**

• The object of the work is to study the probability distribution of the strength of bundles whose constituent threads are sampled randomly from an infinite population of threads in which the probability distribution of strength is known.

• We have also tried to understood the properties of the probability distribution of bundle, where the attention is being confined to the case where all threads have the same load extension curve up to the breaking point.

• We have also explored the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution for large number of threads and trying to show that in the commonest cases the distribution tends to assume the normal form.

**Stochastic modelling and molecular dynamics simulation of fatigue damage in Metals**                                                  
**August 2018 - February 2020**

• In this research project we aim to stochastic-ally determine the fatigue crack propagation in crucial metal weld joints that are used in Nuclear power plant of IGCAR Kalpakkam.

• We have successfully created a Reliability software which can successfully determine the reliability based on present crack growth information and also load history into which the weld is subjected into.

• This software can be used both to model various types of loads and also predict in advance the required safe limit of crack size for future safety and reliabilty of structure.

**Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for Robust Reliability Updating of Structural Dynamic Systems**                                           
**May 2018 - July 2018**

• Worked on an algorithm for updating the robust structural reliability so that any particular response of a structural dynamic system will not reach some specific failure or unfavorable state when it is subjected to future stochastic excitation.

• The proposed approach integrates the Gibbs sampler for Bayesian model updating and subset simulation for failure probability computation.

**August 2019 — November 2019**

• Worked under Prof.Damodar Maity to develop a software written in Python that calculates structural properties for any cross-section imaginable and displays the internal stresses on the section resulting from any combination of design actions.

• The program applies the finite element method to calculate the following Area Properties of the cross section,Warping and Composite Section Properties.The program allows the user to enter the Axial force,Bending moments about the x and y axes,Bending moments about the principal axes,Torsion moment and Shear forces in the x and y directions

• The following stress plots will then be generated: axial, bending, torsion, transverse shear, combined normal, combined shear and von Mises.

• Codes used in the research analyisis are :

**Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression**                                                                              
**March 2020 — July 2020**

• We develop a general framework for distribution-free predictive inference in regression, using conformal inference. The proposed methodology allows for the construction of a prediction band for the response variable using any estimator of the regression function.

• We analyze and compare, both empirically and theoretically, the two major variants of our conformal framework: full conformal inference and split conformal inference, along with a related jackknife method.

• We develop a method for constructing valid in-sample prediction intervals called rank-one-out conformal inference, which has essentially the same computational efficiency as split conformal inference.
