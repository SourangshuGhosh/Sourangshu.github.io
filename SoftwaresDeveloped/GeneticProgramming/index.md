### Cartesian Genetic Programming

<br />Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is an increasingly popular and efficient form of Genetic Programming. Cartesian Genetic Programming is a highly cited technique that was developed by Julian Miller in 1999 and 2000 from some earlier joint work of Julian Miller with Peter Thomson in 1997. In its classic form, it uses a very simple integer based genetic representation of a program in the form of a directed graph. Graphs are very useful program representations and can be applied to many domains (e.g. electronic circuits, neural networks). In a number of studies, CGP has been shown to be comparatively efficient to other GP techniques. It is also very simple to program. Since then, the classical form of CGP has been developed made more efficient in various ways. Notably by including automatically defined functions (modular CGP) and self-modification operators (self-modifying CGP). SMCGP was developed by Julian Miller, Simon Harding and Wolfgang Banzhaf. It uses functions that cause the evolved programs to change themselves as a function of time. Using this technique it is possible to find general solutions to classes of problems and mathematical algorithms (e.g. arbitrary parity, n-bit binary addition, sequences that provably compute pi and e to arbitrary precision, and so on). This tutorial is will cover the basic technique, advanced developments and applications to a variety of problem domains. The first edited book on CGP was published by Springer in September 2011. CGP has its own dedicated website http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk

### Evolutionary Deep Neural Network

,br />Modeling and optimization in many materials related problems routinely involvenoisy,non-lineardatafromdiversesources.Thisnovelalgorithm,nowtested on several problems, eliminates noise and extracts the meaningful trends from such data, using some multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, instead of the existing trainingmethods.Somesmallneuralnetswithﬂexibletopologyandarchitectureare fedwithrandomsubsetsoftheproblemvariables,ensuringthateachvariableisused at least once. They evolve through a tradeoff between two conﬂicting requirements that they should be of maximum accuracy and at the same time of minimum complexity, deﬁned through the number of parameters used. Mathematically, this leads to a Pareto-optimal problem, and the evolutionary algorithms that are used to train them are geared to handle that. These subnets are then assembled using a number of hidden layers; a linear least square algorithm is used for the optimization of the associatedweights

### Genetic Programming for CNN design

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SourangshuGhosh/SourangshuGhosh.github.io/master/Pictures/download3.png)
<br />The convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the deep learning models, has seen much success in a variety of computer vision tasks. However, designing CNN architectures still requires expert knowledge and a lot of trial and error.We attempt to automatically construct CNN architectures for an image classification task based on Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). In our method, we adopt highly functional modules, such as convolutional blocks and tensor concatenation, as the node functions in CGP. The CNN structure and connectivity represented by the CGP encoding method are optimized to maximize the validation accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a CNN architecture for the image classification task with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can be used to automatically find the competitive CNN architecture compared with state-of-the-art models.
