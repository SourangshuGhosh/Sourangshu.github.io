A  **perfectly matched layer**  ( **PML** ) is an artificial absorbing layer for [wave equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation), commonly used to truncate computational regions in [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_method) to simulate problems with open boundaries, especially in the [FDTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) and [FE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) methods.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-Taflove05-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-2) The key property of a PML that distinguishes it from an ordinary absorbing material is that it is designed so that waves incident upon the PML from a non-PML medium do not reflect at the interfaceâ€”this property allows the PML to strongly absorb outgoing waves from the interior of a computational region without reflecting them back into the interior.

PML was originally formulated by Berenger in 1994[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-3) for use with [Maxwell&#39;s equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations), and since that time there have been several related reformulations of PML for both Maxwell&#39;s equations and for other wave-type equations, such as elastodynamics,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-4) the linearized Euler equations, Helmholtz equations, and poroelasticity. Berenger&#39;s original formulation is called a  **split-field PML** , because it splits the [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field) into two unphysical fields in the PML region. A later formulation that has become more popular because of its simplicity and efficiency is called  **uniaxial PML**  or  **UPML** ,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-5) in which the PML is described as an artificial [anisotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence) absorbing material. Although both Berenger&#39;s formulation and UPML were initially derived by manually constructing the conditions under which incident [plane waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave) do not reflect from the PML interface from a homogeneous medium, _both_ formulations were later shown to be equivalent to a much more elegant and general approach:  **stretched-coordinate PML**.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-7) In particular, PMLs were shown to correspond to a [coordinate transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_transformation) in which one (or more) coordinates are mapped to [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number); more technically, this is actually an [analytic continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation) of the wave equation into complex coordinates, replacing propagating (oscillating) waves by [exponentially decaying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentially_decaying) waves. This viewpoint allows PMLs to be derived for inhomogeneous media such as [waveguides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide), as well as for other [coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) and wave equations.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer#cite_note-9)
