# **Skills**

- **Stochastic Simulation and Simulation of Stochastic Process May 2018 — July 2018 and August 2018 - March 2020**

1. I have stochastically simulated the fatigue crack propagation in the development of a software in my research projects under Prof.Baidurya Bhattacharya which can successfully determine the reliability based on present crack growth information.

2. In the research project in CSIR-CMERI on Robust Reliability Updating of Structural Dynamic systems based on incomplete modal data. I have used Gibbs sampler for Bayesian model updating

and subset simulation for failure probability computation. The generation of conditional samples in subset simulation method was done eﬃciently using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.

- **Text Mining December 2018 — February 2018**

1. In my project of Sharing Economy under Prof.Swagato Chatterjee where we have focused on both textual reviews and overall ratings We have adopted Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) ; a text mining approach, to extract keypoints, writers&#39; perceptions, underlying concepts and topics,and hidden semantic meanings from human natural language.

2. Second, we used the text-regression approach,followed by LSA, to investigate the relationship between online reviews and consumer satisfaction and demand. Technically,we used the vector space model for documents,which is a strength of LSA because of its improvement in representing a vector of words in the vector space, compared with traditional vector space models.

- **Machine Learning and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks November 2018 — December 2018**

I have also good experience in Machine Learning and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in my Internship in CSIR-CDRI where we have to scrap data of HIV articles published by Times of India since 2010 until now and classify them using neural network. Analyze the data, use best possible visualization and then write a report about the state of HIV awareness in India. 

- **Civil Engineering Design and Modelling**

I am also skilled in Solidworks,Ansys.I have used Ansys as an software to do Finite Element Analysis of Laminated Composite Beams and Plates to study the mechanical properties and response of unidirectional E-glass in term of tensile, compression and thermal responses.
